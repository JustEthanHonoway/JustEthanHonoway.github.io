    <h1>Overview of Cypher From Valorant</h1>

    <h2>Character</h2>

    <h3>Bio</h3>
    
    <p>Cypher is a fictional character in the popular first-person shooter game Valorant, developed by Riot Games. He is a Moroccan 
      surveillance expert and a key member of the Valorant Protocol, an international task force created to combat a global threat 
      known as "Radiant." Cypher's real name is Aamir, and he was born and raised in Morocco.
    </p>

    <h3>Appearance</h3>

    <p>Cypher's overall appearance resembles a typical depiction of a detective or gumshoe. His main piece of apparel is a large, 
      white coat that extends from his shins up to his neck. This overcoat is where he keeps his utility stored. He wears dull gray 
      pants, which are paired with black shoes. Gold, brown, and blue colors accentuate his predominantly black and white color scheme. 
      Notably, not a single inch of Cypher's skin is directly visible. Aside from his coat and pants, Cypher wears a pair of blue gloves 
      that have a bright glow at the center of the palm, which serves as a magnet and allows for Cypher to recall any of his utilities back 
      to his hand at will. Undoubtedly, the most defining part of his wardrobe is his characteristic mask with hexagonal eye holes that hold 
      a bright blue glow. Cypher wears a hat with an antenna attached to it. This device is what's used to locate and transmit the locations 
      of enemies when Neural Theft is used as it floats over the body at Cypher's command.
    </p>

    <h3>Role in Valorant</h3>

    <p>When Valorant Protocol was established, Aamir was recruited as Cypher, given his unparalleled abilities in surveillance and his deep 
      understanding of security systems. Cypher's primary role within the team is to gather information, provide intelligence, and set up traps 
      to control the battlefield.
    </p>

<h2>Abilities</h2>


<h3>Spycam</h3>
<p>Cypher’s Spycam is his signature ability, allowing him to place a camera anywhere on the map in order to provide real-time intel. While controlling 
  the camera, you can fire a dart that, if it hits an enemy, can show the tagged enemy through walls and on your team’s mini-map. The camera is invisible 
  when it is inactive. But while it is in use, it emits a blue and red light that shows enemies where it is.
</p>

<h3>Trapwire</h3>

<p>Cypher’s Trapwires are one of his defensive abilities. When placed, the Trapwire will extend from one wall to another, creating a trap that if triggered,
   will show enemies through walls and on the team’s mini-map. The Trapwire is invisible to enemies. When approached by an enemy, the Trapwire plays a faint
    buzzing sound and briefly shows a glimpse of its location. The trapwire can be destroyed by the enemies guns and damaging abilities.
</p>

<h3>Cyber Cage</h3>

<p>The Cyber cage is Cypher’s vision blocking tool. Cypher is able to throw down this activatable “cyber-smoke” that when passed through by an enemy, plays a 
  sound and provides a visual to indicate that someone is in the Cyber cage. The Cyber Cage is invisible to enemies and cannot be destroyed. Cypher is able to set
   these cages up and then activate them when the time feels right. 
</p>

<h3>Neural Theft</h3>

<p>Neural Theft is Cypher’s ultimate ability. This allows him to extract information from the corpse of an enemy player, revealing the location of the entire opposing 
  team twice, revealing them through walls and on the team’s mini-map. 
</p>

<h2>Playstyle</h2>

<h3>Role in Game</h3>

<p>Cypher is one of four “Sentinels” in Valorant. Sentinels are one of the four roles that agents are divided into in VALORANT. The abilities of agents under 
  this role focus on defensive play, with emphasis on supporting the rest of the team through providing intel, anchoring down sites, and preventing the enemy 
  from flanking. Compared to the other agents in Valorant, Cypher’s abilities seem pretty lacking due to the fact they don’t damage enemies. Take the agent Raze 
  for example. She is a Duelist that has grenades, an explosive roomba-type robot, and explosive charges that propel her into the air. Compared to Cypher, her 
  abilities seem crazy. So I ask this question, Why play Cypher?</p>

	<p>Cypher is highly referred to as: “The Big Brain” Agent. His abilities are used for intel, which is crucial to a game like Valorant. A 5v5 can easily turn into
   a 3v5 or even a loss due to lack of info. Cypher’s kit allows you to be able to watch a location without even having to be there. His Spycam is great for
    spotting enemies without having to peek out yourself and risk getting picked off. His tripwires are amazing for “walling-off” flanks due to you being able to
     know if someone walks through it or getting destroyed. And his Cyber cage allows you to set up great defenses to stall for your teammates to rotate to your
      position. Ultimately, playing Cypher requires a thoughtful and strategic approach, emphasizing map awareness, information gathering, and supporting your team.
       If you enjoy a more calculated and tactical playstyle, with a focus on map control, surveillance, and outsmarting your opponents, Cypher can be an excellent
        choice for you in Valorant.
</p>

<h3>Attack</h3>

<p>How do you play Cypher on attack? He is a Sentinel, he should be a defense only character. Well, yes and no. Cypher works well on attack because he is a great defense character. If your team is pushing a site and you do not want to worry about people flanking you and your team, you can place a trapwire behind your team's push to effectively close off that flank so that enemies would be discouraged from approaching you from behind. Cypher is also an amazing “Lurker” since his abilities kind of focus more on defense and info-gathering. You can set up your defenses behind your team and go on a flank of your own. This can open up to some great plays where your team is pushing a site and your enemies are rotating off of the other site to help their team out, allowing you to pick them off while they are rushing towards the site your team is attacking. Cypher is also a great tool to getting on to sites as well, his Cyber Cages allow you and your team to push onto a site, leaving the enemies confused on how many of you are in the cages since it only plays a sound if enemies go through them. The cages can act as a wall that wards enemies away from pushing because of the sound that plays when they walk through it, revealing their location. Remember that playing Cypher on attack may require a more adaptive and supportive playstyle compared to other agents. Your primary focus should be on gathering information, providing utility to your team, and creating advantageous situations for your team's entry fraggers. By effectively utilizing your abilities and communicating with your teammates, you can contribute to a successful attack round in Valorant. </p>

<h3>Defence</h3>

<p>This is where Cypher shines the brightest. Defense is Cypher’s playhouse. With his abilities, Cypher can effectively close off a choke point to a site, forcing enemies to seek an alternate route, or avoid that site entirely. Cypher’s presence on a site should leave enemies afraid to approach. Cyphers tripwires can be placed strategically to force enemies to go a different route or have to push through your Trapwire, revealing them to your team. You can also put your Cyber Cage near your tripwire so that it could work as a one-way window which if an enemy triggers your Trapwire, you can activate the Cage so that only you and your team can see them, leaving the enemy really screwed. The use of your camera can also allow you to survey an entire site and its chokepoints without you or a teammate risking getting picked off. The camera can also be used aggressively at the start of the round to see if enemies are pushing a site or not. That info can help your team decide if they want to rotate a few over to the site that is being targeted before they initiate. Remember, as Cypher on defense, your primary objective is to gather information and deny enemy advances. Prioritize map control, communication, and setting up traps strategically to give your team an advantage. By playing patiently, reacting to enemy movements, and providing valuable support, you can be a formidable defender in Valorant.
